A penguin is a flightless bird native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Antarctica. Known for their distinctive black and white plumage, penguins are highly adapted to aquatic life, using their flipper-like wings to propel themselves through water with remarkable agility. They primarily feed on fish, squid, and other marine organisms. Penguins are social animals, often forming large colonies for breeding and protection. Their unique adaptations, such as a layer of insulating feathers and a thick layer of fat, help them survive in some of the harshest climates on Earth.
